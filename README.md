# Railway Booking System

## Overview
The Railway Booking System is a console-based application implemented in C++ that allows users to book train tickets, view reservations, and manage bookings. The system also provides an administrative panel to manage train schedules and seats.

This project demonstrates practical application of data structures such as linked lists and sorting algorithms, along with modular programming and file handling techniques.

## Features

### User Features
- Reserve train tickets
- View existing reservations
- Cancel tickets
- Edit passenger details

### Admin Features
- View all booked tickets
- Add new trains to the system
- Manage train schedules and seat availability

### Additional Features
- Dynamic seat selection with file storage
- Simulated payment integration (e.g., VodafoneCash, InstaPay, and credit/debit cards)
- Real-time input validation

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: C++
- File Handling: For persistent storage of seat details
- Dynamic Memory: Linked lists for managing bookings
- Sorting: Efficient management of train schedules

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Visual Studio)
- Command-line interface
- `Seat_Details.txt` file for managing seat availability

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate a graphical user interface (GUI)
- Transition to a database for improved scalability and security
- Add real-world payment gateway integration
